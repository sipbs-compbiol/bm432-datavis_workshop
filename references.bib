@ARTICLE{Zacks1999-ph,
  title     = "Bars and lines: a study of graphic communication",
  author    = "Zacks, J and Tversky, B",
  abstract  = "Interpretations of graphs seem to be rooted in principles of
               cognitive naturalness and information processing rather than
               arbitrary correspondences. These predict that people should more
               readily associate bars with discrete comparisons between data
               points because bars are discrete entities and facilitate point
               estimates. They should more readily associate lines with trends
               because lines connect discrete entities and directly represent
               slope. The predictions were supported in three experiments--two
               examining comprehension and one production. The correspondence
               does not seem to depend on explicit knowledge of rules. Instead,
               it may reflect the influence of the communicative situation as
               well as the perceptual properties of graphs.",

  abstract  = "Figures in scientific publications are critically important
               because they often show the data supporting key findings. Our
               systematic review of research articles published in top
               physiology journals (n = 703) suggests that, as scientists, we
               urgently need to change our practices for presenting continuous
               data in small sample size studies. Papers rarely included
               scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to
               critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented
               continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as
               many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or
               line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from
               the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in
               data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of
               data, and changing journal editorial policies. Investigators can
               quickly make univariate scatterplots for small sample size
               studies using our Excel templates.",
