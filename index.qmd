Welcome to the BM432 Data Visualisation Workshop.

## Introduction

The amount of data being generated and processed in biological sciences is always increasing, seemingly at an ever-faster pace. As a scientist you will have to learn to work with this data, telling a clear story about your science, and interpreting other people's work accurately, without being overwhelmed by its sheer volume and complexity. 

Data visualisation is a tool that allows us to summarise, understand, and explore our - sometimes incredibly large - datasets intuitively. In this workshop, we will focus on common approaches by which statistical data can and should be summarised visually, with an emphasis on best practice.

Data visualisation is a broad topic that touches on elements of colour theory, psychology, graphic design, and several other fields that we sadly donâ€™t have time to explore, here. But we will provide links to help you learn more about this area, in your own time.
