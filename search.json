The second quartile is the same thing as the median.\nThe interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the first and third quartiles, i.e. \\(\\textrm{third quartile} - \\textrm{first quartile}\\). In Normally-distributed data, the median should be about halfway between the first and third quartiles.

Humans find it easier to judge differences between lengths than between areas, and differences between areas than differences between angles. Pie charts use angle and area to represent data; bar charts use area and length; and dot charts use length alone. It is difficult - unless the data is specifically ordered - to rank categories in bar charts and pie charts; it is much easier to do so with dot charts.\nAlso, pie charts can only represent proportional data well, and are less suited to showing absolute counts. They are more limited than bar charts or dot charts (which can each represent exactly the same data as the pie chart, and much more), and less easy to understand than the equivalent stacked bar chart.

Figure 2 demonstrates that induction of chlorosis was stronger for AvrY than for AvrX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bar chart showing amount of chlorosis in leaves after application of AvrX and AvrY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nHow does Figure 2 support the statement that AvrY induces chlorosis more strongly than AvrX?\nWhat information is present in Figure 2?\nWhat information do you think you need that is not present in Figure 2?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich bar is larger? By how much?\nWhat is the extent of induction of chlorosis in each case? How variable is the extent of chlorosis in individual leaves?\nIs the difference in chlorosis biologically meaningful?\n\n\n\n\nAs it stands we dont know what the chlorosis measurements are, which means we can’t interpret them as “strong” or “weak”, and we can’t tell how different the values are for AvrX and AvrY. We can improve this plot by indicating what quantities are meant by the bars in the chart, adding values on the y-axis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bar chart showing effect of chlorosis due to application of AvrX and AvrY, with observed chlorosis values indicated on the y-axis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhat conclusions can you draw from Figure 3 that couldn’t be drawn from Figure 2?\nIs Figure 3 a fair representation of the data?\nDoes the figure still support the statement that AvrY induces chlorosis more strongly than AvrX?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich bar is larger? By how much?\nIs the difference in bar sizes proportionate to the difference in extent of chlorosis? How variable are the measurements?\nIs the difference in chlorosis biologically meaningful?\n\n\n\n\nNow we can read off the chart that AvrX has a value of 9.5 and AvrY has a value of about 9.75. If we knew more about chlorosis, we could now tell if this was a strong or a weak effect.\nBut there is something not right about this graphic. The blue bar looks to be twice the size of the green block, yet the difference between values is only \\(\\frac{0.25}{0.95} = 2.5\\%\\)! It would be fairer to start the y-axis at zero, so that the areas of each bar are related to the absolute difference between observed values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow humans interpret graphs (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch shows that people do, in fact, interpret bar charts by bar area, not bar height. Humans have a limited repertoire of elementary perceptual tasks that we use to extract data and information from graphical representation. Graphs may use these well for communication, or misuse them to fool the reader. A number of studies empirically test people’s ability to correctly “read” graph types, and a couple of these are indicated below..\n\nCleveland, W.S. & McGill, R. (1984) “Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods” J. Am. Stat. Ass. 79 531-554 https://doi.org/10.2307/2288400\nHeer, J. & Bostock, M.

That is not always true. Figures should be read at least as carefully as the text.\n\n\nThere is one more thing we need to make proper sense of the figure. At the moment, the values for AvrX and AvrY are presented as single values: one location for each gene. But we saw at the start of the story that 30 plants were measured:\n\nWe measured chlorosis in 30 plants after the application of either AvrX or AvrY. The figure demonstrates that the induction of chlorosis was stronger for AvrY than for AvrX.\n\nIt’s unlikely that all of the measurements for each gene were identical. We would assume that there has been some spread of data around that location. This spread is commonly represented with error bars, as in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Bar chart showing effect of chlorosis due to application of AvrX and AvrY, with the y-axis starting at zero, values marked on that axis, and error bars indicating standard deviation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhat conclusions can you draw from Figure 5 that couldn’t be drawn from Figure 5?\nDoes Figure 5 tell the same story as Figure 4?\nIs there anything else we might still want to know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow variable are the measurements for AvrX and AvrY?\nIs the difference in bar sizes proportionate to the difference in extent of chlorosis?\nWhat do the error bars mean?

As a scientist you will have to learn to work with this data, telling a clear story about your science, and interpreting other people’s work accurately, without being overwhelmed by its sheer volume and complexity.\nData visualisation is a tool that allows us to summarise, understand, and explore our - sometimes incredibly large - datasets intuitively. In this workshop, we will focus on common approaches by which statistical data can and should be summarised visually, with an emphasis on best practice.\nData visualisation is a broad topic that touches on elements of colour theory, psychology, graphic design, and several other fields that we sadly don’t have time to explore, here. But we will provide links to help you learn more about this area, in your own time."

This kind of data is well-represented by a dot chart (essentially, a univariate scatterplot with a single value) or bar chart.\nBut, if the data is proportion or percentage data, and we want to emphasise the proportion of the total, a more natural representation might seem to be the stacked/divided bar chart or pie chart. However, there is no data that can be represented by a bar chart or pie chart that cannot be represented by a dot chart, and a dot chart is often the clearest representation."

    "text": "Graphical relationships representing comparisons of categorical variables aren’t very common. They are conceptually not very difficult, but few tools have provided a ready way to generate suitable figures (scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts are more readily found). However, tools like GGally in R make complex graphs accessible, and that package provides a figure style that is a grid of rectangles with proportional areas.\nIn Figure 1, the proporition of Titanic survivors by sex is shown, where larger rectangles indicate a larger absolute count (here, area is proportional to count).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Proportional area comparison of Titanic survivors by sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis representation is an intuitive graphical version of the comparisons in a chi-square test.\n\n\nOne advantage of this representation is that we can use the stacked bar representation (see above) to subdivide each of the rectangular areas by a further categorical variable, as in Figure 2 where we divide the blocks representing passengers conditioned on sex and survival, according to class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proportional area comparison of Titanic survivors by sex, with stacked bar representation of class."
