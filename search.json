This allows all values in a dataset to be shown, which is the most transparent way of presenting the data to the reader.\nWhere there is potential for overlap of datapoints, their locations can be “jittered” - moved slightly in a horizontal and/or vertical direction - in order to make the number of datapoints at each value clearer. It is however not always possible to interpret the density of datapoints very well, so this representation is best combined with a summary of the distribution that conveys this information also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Univariate (1D) scatterplot of sepal length for each species from the iris dataset, with jitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nA univariate scatterplot for the iris sepal length data in Figure @ref(fig:1d-scatterplot) shows the distributions of this variable overlap for each species, and that there is a possible outlier in the I. virginica data. The nature of the data is also evident: the datapoints are regularly-spaced, and we can see where there are relatively few or many datapoints."

You have already seen a number of scatterplots, and you will be aware that the convention is to plot the explanatory (also known as independent) variable on the x-axis, and the response (or dependent) variable on the y-axis. But when exploring datasets we may not always know which parameters or variables control the response, and we may be looking at - or mining - the data for correlations. In those cases the convention is often relaxed.\nIn figure Figure 1 we plot Sepal.Length against Sepal.Width for the iris dataset, to see if there is any obvious relationship.\nFigure 1: Scatterplot of sepal length against sepal width for the iris dataset."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Pie charts are frequently criticised. In my view this is with good reason. Humans find it easier to judge differences between lengths than between areas, and differences between areas than differences between angles. Pie charts use angle and area to represent data; bar charts use area and length; and dot charts use length alone. It is difficult - unless the data is specifically ordered - to rank categories in bar charts and pie charts; it is much easier to do so with dot charts.\nAlso, pie charts can only represent proportional data well, and are less suited to showing absolute counts. They are more limited than bar charts or dot charts (which can each represent exactly the same data as the pie chart, and much more), and less easy to understand than the equivalent stacked bar chart. But, for completeness, the class data for the Titanic passenger list is presented in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Pie chart of proportion of passengers on the Titanic, by class\n\n\n\n\n\nA benefit to pie charts is that people recognise “anchor points” on the circle. We can recognise 25% (90 degrees), 50% (180 degrees) and 75% marks quite well, but it is unusual to be able to distinguish well between other angles. This is particularly problematic for small angles, and large numbers of categories."

However there is a disadvantage that each bar may obscure others behind it. An attempt has been made in this figure to reduce this problem with the use of transparancy (also known as alpha channel), but the image is still not very clear.\nThe “neatness” of a histogram is essentially controlled by a single parameter: the bin width. This defines the width of the bars in the histogram. Too small, and each bar has a count of one or zero (also known as a rug plot). Too large, and the shape of the data is masked."

The box represents the first, second and third quartiles of the dataset, and the whiskers extend to \\(1.5 \\times \\textrm{IQR}\\), where \\(\\textrm{IQR}\\) is the interquartile range of the data.

Here, that means any value in the dataset that lies outwith \\(1.5 \\times \\textrm{IQR}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipQuartiles (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuartiles are obtained by taking each value in the data and sorting them from smallest to largest value, in an ordered list. The quartiles are then the values at one quarter (25%, first quartile), halfway (50%, second quartile) and three-quarters (75%, third quartile) along the list. The second quartile is the same thing as the median.\nThe interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the first and third quartiles, i.e. \\(\\textrm{third quartile} - \\textrm{first quartile}\\). In Normally-distributed data, the median should be about halfway between the first and third quartiles. If the median is skewed towards one or other quartile, then the data is unlikely to be Normally-distributed, and this should affect your choice of statistical test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Boxplot/box-and-whisker plot of sepal length for each species from the iris dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nOutliers are datapoints that appear to be quite different from the rest of the observations for that variable. This is often taken to be a warning sign, but outliers need to be handled with care as they can arise for a number of different reasons, not all of which pose a problem:\n\nMeasurement error (e.g. the number was written down incorrectly, or a device was uncalibrated)\nExperimental error (e.g. some solution was prepared at the wrong concentration, or a measurement was made badly)\nThe distribution of the data does not meet assumptions about interquartile range (i.e. extreme values are more commmon than assumed)\nOther problems with the experimental design, or the theory behind the experiment\n\nOutliers should not be deleted from the dataset unless they are caused by experimental or recording error. If outliers result from deficiencies in experimental design or faulty assumptions, then those should be addressed instead."

As a scientist you will have to learn to work with this data, telling a clear story about your science, and interpreting other people’s work accurately, without being overwhelmed by its sheer volume and complexity.\nData visualisation is a tool that allows us to summarise, understand, and explore our - sometimes incredibly large - datasets intuitively. In this workshop, we will focus on common approaches by which statistical data can and should be summarised visually, with an emphasis on best practice.\nData visualisation is a broad topic that touches on elements of colour theory, psychology, graphic design, and several other fields that we sadly don’t have time to explore, here. But we will provide links to help you learn more about this area, in your own time."

However, tools like GGally in R make complex graphs accessible, and that package provides a figure style that is a grid of rectangles with proportional areas.\nIn Figure 1, the proporition of Titanic survivors by sex is shown, where larger rectangles indicate a larger absolute count (here, area is proportional to count).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Proportional area comparison of Titanic survivors by sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis representation is an intuitive graphical version of the comparisons in a chi-square test.\n\n\nOne advantage of this representation is that we can use the stacked bar representation (see above) to subdivide each of the rectangular areas by a further categorical variable, as in Figure 2 where we divide the blocks representing passengers conditioned on sex and survival, according to class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proportional area comparison of Titanic survivors by sex, with stacked bar representation of class."

    "text": "2 A scientific story\nHere’s a story as it might appear in a presentation or a paper, told with a single figure:\n\n2.1 A story: “AvrY induces chlorosis more strongly than AvrX”\nSuppose you’re reading a manuscript, and the text makes this claim:\n\nWe measured chlorosis in 30 plants after the application of either AvrX or AvrY. Figure 2 demonstrates that induction of chlorosis was stronger for AvrY than for AvrX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bar chart showing amount of chlorosis in leaves after application of AvrX and AvrY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout-questionsQuestions\n\n\n\n\nHow does Figure 2 support the statement that AvrY induces chlorosis more strongly than AvrX?\nWhat information is present in Figure 2?\nWhat information do you think you need that is not present in Figure 2?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout-hintsHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich bar is larger? By how much?\nWhat is the extent of induction of chlorosis in each case? How variable is the extent of chlorosis in individual leaves?\nIs the difference in chlorosis biologically meaningful?\n\n\n\n\nAs it stands we dont know what the chlorosis measurements are, which means we can’t interpret them as “strong” or “weak”, and we can’t tell how different the values are for AvrX and AvrY. We can improve this plot by indicating what quantities are meant by the bars in the chart, adding values on the y-axis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bar chart showing effect of chlorosis due to application of AvrX and AvrY, with observed chlorosis values indicated on the y-axis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout-questionsQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhat conclusions can you draw from Figure 3 that couldn’t be drawn from Figure 2?\nIs Figure 3 a fair representation of the data?\nDoes the figure still support the statement that AvrY induces chlorosis more strongly than AvrX?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout-hintsHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich bar is larger? By how much?\nIs the difference in bar sizes proportionate to the difference in extent of chlorosis? How variable are the measurements?\nIs the difference in chlorosis biologically meaningful?\n\n\n\n\nNow we can read off the chart that AvrX has a value of 9.5 and AvrY has a value of about 9.75. If we knew more about chlorosis, we could now tell if this was a strong or a weak effect.\nBut there is something not right about this graphic. The blue bar looks to be twice the size of the green block, yet the difference between values is only \\(\\frac{0.25}{0.95} = 2.5\\%\\)! It would be fairer to start the y-axis at zero, so that the areas of each bar are related to the absolute difference between observed values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHow humans interpret graphs (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch shows that people do, in fact, interpret bar charts by bar area, not bar height. Humans have a limited repertoire of elementary perceptual tasks that we use to extract data and information from graphical representation (Cleveland and McGill (1984)). Graphs may use these well for communication, or misuse them to fool the reader.\nA number of studies empirically test people’s ability to correctly “read” graph types, and the results indicate that bar charts do not perform very well (Heer and Bostock (2010)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Bar chart showing effect of chlorosis due to application of AvrX and AvrY, with the y-axis starting at zero, and values marked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout-questionsQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhat conclusions can you draw from Figure 4 that couldn’t be drawn from Figure 3?\nDoes Figure 4 tell the same story as Figure 3?\nIs there anything else we still need to know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout-hintsHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the difference in bar sizes proportionate to the difference in extent of chlorosis?\nIs the difference in chlorosis biologically meaningful?\nHow variable are the measurements for AvrX and AvrY?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen we read the literature, it is tempting to skim over papers and “read the figures,” trusting that they tell an unbiased and fair story about the data. That is not always true. Figures should be read at least as carefully as the text.\n\n\nThere is one more thing we need to make proper sense of the figure. At the moment, the values for AvrX and AvrY are presented as single values: one location for each gene. But we saw at the start of the story that 30 plants were measured:\n\nWe measured chlorosis in 30 plants after the application of either AvrX or AvrY. The figure demonstrates that the induction of chlorosis was stronger for AvrY than for AvrX.\n\nIt’s unlikely that all of the measurements for each gene were identical. We would assume that there has been some spread of data around that location. This spread is commonly represented with error bars, as in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Bar chart showing effect of chlorosis due to application of AvrX and AvrY, with the y-axis starting at zero, values marked on that axis, and error bars indicating standard deviation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout-questionsQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhat conclusions can you draw from Figure 5 that couldn’t be drawn from Figure 5?\nDoes Figure 5 tell the same story as Figure 4?\nIs there anything else we might still want to know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout-hintsHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow variable are the measurements for AvrX and AvrY?\nIs the difference in bar sizes proportionate to the difference in extent of chlorosis?\nWhat do the error bars mean? Do they fairly represent the spread of measurements that were made?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs it happens, there is more that we might want to know, and you can explore this in the interactive session at the link below:\n\n3a.
